- Character Display: Display an animated, anime-style virtual assistant character, generated from a vector graphics file.
- Soft Lighting: The background should render with soft lighting effects.

- User Input: Provide a text box or conversational UI for initiating the chat session.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light pastel pink (#FFD1DC) to evoke warmth and friendliness, reflecting the character's gentle nature.
- Background color: Very light desaturated pink (#F8E8EE). Its brightness complements the light color scheme, offering a soft backdrop.
- Accent color: Pale lavender (#E6E6FA), used to highlight interactive elements. The hue sits close to the primary but is different enough to draw attention, and it differs sufficiently in both saturation and brightness.
- Font: 'Poppins', a geometric sans-serif with a precise, contemporary, fashionable, avant-garde look; suitable for short amounts of text, but not for long lines of text
- Use cute, rounded icons in a light, pastel color palette for interactive elements like settings, history, and other controls.
- Implement subtle animations such as gentle swaying of the character, blinking, and slight head movements to bring the virtual assistant to life.
- Arrange the UI elements to mimic a clean, cozy room setup, enhancing the virtual assistant's approachable and friendly demeanor.
